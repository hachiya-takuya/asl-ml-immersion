You can also leverage human evaluation methods. Human evaluation methods involve asking humans to rate the quality of the LLM's answers. This can be done through crowdsourcing or by having experts evaluate the responses. Some standard human evaluation metrics include fluency, coherence, relevance, and informativeness. Often you want to choose a mix of evaluation metrics to get a good understanding of your model performance. \n",
