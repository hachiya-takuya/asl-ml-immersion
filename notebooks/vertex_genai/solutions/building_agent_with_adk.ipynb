If the LLM determines that a query aligns better with a sub-agent's described capability (e.g., \"Handles simple greetings\"), it will automatically generate a special internal action to *transfer control* to that sub-agent for that turn. The sub-agent then processes the query using its own model, instructions, and tools.\n",

    "## Adding Memory and Personalization with Session State\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our agent team can handle different tasks through delegation, but each interaction starts fresh – the agents have no memory of past conversations or user preferences within a session. To create more sophisticated and context-aware experiences, agents need **memory**. ADK provides this through **Session State**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Session State?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a Python dictionary (`session.state`) tied to a specific user session (identified by `APP_NAME`, `USER_ID`, `SESSION_ID`).  \n",
    "* It persists information *across multiple conversational turns* within that session.  \n",
    "* Agents and Tools can read from and write to this state, allowing them to remember details, adapt behavior, and personalize responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Agents Interact with State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`ToolContext` (Primary Method):** Tools can accept a `ToolContext` object (automatically provided by ADK if declared as the last argument). This object gives direct access to the session state via `tool_context.state`, allowing tools to read preferences or save results *during* execution.  \n",
    "2. **`output_key` (Auto-Save Agent Response):** An `Agent` can be configured with an `output_key=\"your_key\"`. ADK will then automatically save the agent's final textual response for a turn into `session.state[\"your_key\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this step, we will enhance our Weather Bot team by:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a **new** `InMemorySessionService` to demonstrate state in isolation.  \n",
    "2. Initializing session state with a user preference for `temperature_unit`.  \n",
    "3. Creating a state-aware version of the weather tool (`get_weather_stateful`) that reads this preference via `ToolContext` and adjusts its output format (Celsius/Fahrenheit).  \n",
    "4. Updating the root agent to use this stateful tool and configuring it with an `output_key` to automatically save its final weather report to the session state.  \n",
    "5. Running a conversation to observe how the initial state affects the tool, how manual state changes alter subsequent behavior, and how `output_key` persists the agent's response."

    "### 4\\. Interact and Test State Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's execute a conversation designed to test the state interactions using the `runner_root_stateful` (associated with our stateful agent and the `session_service_stateful`). We'll use the `call_agent_async` function defined earlier, ensuring we pass the correct runner, user ID (`USER_ID_STATEFUL`), and session ID (`SESSION_ID_STATEFUL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation flow will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Check weather (London):** The `get_weather_stateful` tool should read the initial \"Celsius\" preference from the session state initialized in Section 1. The root agent's final response (the weather report in Celsius) should get saved to `state['last_weather_report']` via the `output_key` configuration.\n",
    "2.  **Manually update state:** We will *directly modify* the state stored within the `InMemorySessionService` instance (`session_service_stateful`).\n",
    "    *   **Why direct modification?** The `session_service.get_session()` method returns a *copy* of the session. Modifying that copy wouldn't affect the state used in subsequent agent runs. For this testing scenario with `InMemorySessionService`, we access the internal `sessions` dictionary to change the *actual* stored state value for `user_preference_temperature_unit` to \"Fahrenheit\". *Note: In real applications, state changes are typically triggered by tools or agent logic returning `EventActions(state_delta=...)`, not direct manual updates.*\n",
    "3.  **Check weather again (New York):** The `get_weather_stateful` tool should now read the updated \"Fahrenheit\" preference from the state and convert the temperature accordingly. The root agent's *new* response (weather in Fahrenheit) will overwrite the previous value in `state['last_weather_report']` due to the `output_key`.\n",
    "4.  **Greet the agent:** Verify that delegation to the `greeting_agent` still works correctly alongside the stateful operations. This interaction will become the *last* response saved by `output_key` in this specific sequence.\n",
    "5.  **Inspect final state:** After the conversation, we retrieve the session one last time (getting a copy) and print its state to confirm the `user_preference_temperature_unit` is indeed \"Fahrenheit\", observe the final value saved by `output_key` (which will be the greeting in this run), and see the `last_city_checked_stateful` value written by the tool.\n"
