    "# Semantic Matching with the PaLM API\n",

    "Semantic matching is the problem of classifying a pair of entities $(x_1, x_2)$ as being a good match or not. So it is a classification setup that is a very flexible: Namely, it comprises general information retrieval (where the first entity can be a textual query and the second entity can be a paragraph for instance), entity resolutions, or database-record fuzzy-matching. In this notebook we will focus on matching textual descriptions of retail products. More specifically:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Use case description:** An online retail company scours the web to compare prices of products in their inventory with those offered by their competitors. Their first priority is to implement a model that compares the information on two product webpages and outputs a classification indicating whether the different product descriptions on the webpages correspond to an identical product, which we will refer to as a 'match'. We use the [Amazon-Google Products dataset](https://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/file/Amazon-GoogleProducts.zip) in the [entity resolution benchmark](https://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/research/projects/object_matching/benchmark_datasets_for_entity_resolution) created by Leipzig University. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model description:** This notebook illustrates how to use PaLM API in Vertex AI to match product descriptions. The [Amazon-GoogleProducts dataset](https://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/file/Amazon-GoogleProducts.zip) contains product information about the products scrapped on Amazon or Google websites. It includes the products title, description, price, and manufacturer, athough this information is worded differently on the two websites. In this notebook, we will focus solely on building a model using the product titles. The idea is straightforward: we will create a prompt that asks the PaLM API whether the product titles match or not. Although the information about the products is limited to these titles, we still achieve an accuracy close to 100% on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation method:** In order to avoid overfitting the prompt design on our dataset, we first split the our dataset sample of paired descriptions into an evaluation set (evalset) containing 60 examples and a test set (testset) also consisting of 60 examples. The choice of 60 examples aligns with the current limit quota of 60 requests per minute for the PaLM API in Vertex AI. Subsequently, we devise the prompt using the evalset and report the model's accuracy on the testset. Both the evaluation and test sets are roughly balanced."

PaLM, as all LLM's, has been trained to predict the next most likely word from a sequence of words. Therefore, although we instruct PaLM explicitely in our prompt to answer by `yes` or `no`, it may happen that certain product descriptions confuse PaLM, resulting in something different from `yes` or `no`. Another issue is that the language in the product descriptions may trigger a safety filter, which then will replace PaLM raw answer by some standard warning text. These safety filters can be triggered by words in the product descriptions that are too evocating of health or medical issues for instance, or violence, among many [other safety settings](https://developers.generativeai.google/guide/safety_setting).
