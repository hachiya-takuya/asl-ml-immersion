    "In this notebook, we implement a simple (albeit fast and scalable) [semantic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search#:~:text=Semantic%20search%20seeks%20to%20improve,to%20generate%20more%20relevant%20results.) retrieval system using [Vertex Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview) and [Vertex Text Embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings). In a semantic search system, a number of documents are returned to a user query, ranked by their semantic match. This means that the returned documents should match the intent or meaning of the query rather than its actual exact  keywords as opposed to a boolean or keyword-based retrieval system. Such a semantic search system has in general two components, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A component that produces semantically meaningful vector representations of both the documents as well as the user queries; we will use the [Vertex Text Embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) API to creates these embeddings, leveraging the power of large language model. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A component that allows users to store the document vector embeddings and retrieve the most relevant documents by returning the documents whose embeddings are the closest to the user-query embedding in the embedding space. We will use [Vertex Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview) which can scale up to billions of embeddings thanks to an [efficient approximate nearest neighbor strategy](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-scann-efficient-vector.html) to compare and retrieve the closest document vectors to a query vector based on a [recent paper from Google research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10396).\n",

    "](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge), which contains around 1 million of medical research papers focused on COVID 19. We will focus on only 4000 titles, abstracts, and urls from 2021 only for the sake of speed.\n"

We choose here the `COSINE_DISTANCE` which essentially is a measure of the angle between the embedding vectors. Other possible choices are the square of the euclidean distance (`SQUARED_L2_DISTANCE`), the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) (`L1_DISTANCE`), or the dot product distance (`DOT_PRODUCT_DISTANCE`). (Note that if the embeddings you are using have been trained to minimize the one of these distances between matching pairs, then you may get better results by selecting this particular distance, otherwise the `COSINE_DISTANCE` will do just fine.) \n",

       "            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) onset in December 2019 is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 have continued to increase daily leading to a pandemic. In absence of approved medicine and vaccines, many countries imposed policies such as social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, airport screening, quarantine and others. But rapidly, they were confronted with the high economic and social cost resulting from those policies. Many vaccines have been proposed but their efficiency is still controversial. Now, governments and scholars search for how manage with preventives measures policies and vaccination campaigns to stop the COVID-19 spread. This work studied the effects of these different strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contribution in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number was computed with and without respect of preventives measures. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin’s maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings revealed that the optimal implementation of preventive measures reduce highly the number of infected individuals but zero infection was not achieved in the population. That was obtained with the optimal implementation of vaccination campaigns which reduce the number of infected individuals. But the optimal and combined implementation of the two interventions performed better with less costs than the two singular implementations.</p>\n",

       "            <p>Introdução A doença coronavírus 2019 (COVID-19) é uma infecção respiratória causada pelo coronavírus 2 da síndrome respiratória aguda grave (SARS-CoV-2), com uma gravidade dos sintomas que varia de uma doença leve a uma pneumonia viral grave que leva à síndrome do desconforto respiratório agudo potencialmente fatal. Os sintomas mais comuns são: febre, tosse, dispneia, mialgia e cansaço. A taxa de letalidade é baixa nas faixas etárias mais baixas e aumenta após os 60 anos de idade. Alguns estudos apontam que o vírus SARS-CoV-2 pode sobreviver em superfícies por vários dias, dependendo do tipo, temperatura ou umidade do ambiente. Os serviços de saúde, enquanto serviços essenciais, devem ter o cuidado excepcional para evitar a contaminação dos equipamentos, pacientes e profissionais. Em tempos de pandemia, tomar medidas que garantam a prevenção, a minimização ou a eliminação de riscos à saúde é fundamental. Por décadas, as normas relativas à biossegurança foram negligenciadas, mas, com o advento da COVID-19, medidas básicas estão sendo reconsideradas, principalmente no que diz respeito aos cuidados necessários para a minimização dos riscos biológicos ao profissional da saúde. A Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) define a Biossegurança como um conjunto de medidas técnicas que são de suma importância durante a manipulação de agentes e materiais biológicos. Inúmeras são as ações de controle que estão sendo reforçadas a partir das experiências de outros países e da experiência de saúde acumulada em tratamento de outras doenças respiratórias que apresentam meios de transmissão semelhante ao da COVID-19. Objetivo Descrever as medidas de biossegurança utilizadas para prevenção da Covid 19; Contribuir com a construção de conhecimento sobre a Covid 19. Metodologia Assim, baseados nestas experiências, faremos um relato de experiência das ações que foram tomadas para mitigar o efeito da COVID-19 em profissionais de saúde de um Hemocentro de Fortaleza. As medidas de enfretamento ao Covid 19 foram correlacionadas em cinco tópicos: Biossegurança e Trabalhador, Comunicação, Portas de Entrada, Doadores/ Pacientes e Insumos e EPIs. Conclusão Os estudos e autoridades sanitárias de saúde mundial, nacional, estadual e municipal ainda não indicam um período para finalização da pandemia provocada pelo novo coronavírus. A importância de elaborar um Plano de Biossegurança veio garantir a segurança dos profissionais bem como pacientes/ doadores que precisam de atendimento no serviço. O trabalho de educação em saúde deve ser permanente visto que a doença vem sendo estudada e que pouco se sabe. As novas evidências apontam para cepas variantes fazendo com que as medidas de precauções não cessem e que os cuidados sejam redobrados, contínuos e regados de conscientização acerca das medidas sociais de minimização de contaminação.</p>\n",

       "            <p>The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic poses significant health risks to workers who are essential to maintaining the food supply chain. Using a quantitative risk assessment model, this study characterized the impact of risk reduction strategies for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission (droplet, aerosol, fomite-mediated) among front-line workers in a representative indoor fresh fruit and vegetable manufacturing facility. We simulated: 1) individual and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection risks from close contact (droplet and aerosols at 1–3 m), aerosol, and fomite-mediated exposures to a susceptible worker following exposure to an infected worker during an 8 h-shift; and 2) the relative reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk attributed to infection control interventions (physical distancing, mask use, ventilation, surface disinfection, hand hygiene, vaccination). Without mitigation measures, the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk was largest for close contact (droplet and aerosol) at 1 m (0.96, 5th – 95th percentile: 0.67–1.0). In comparison, risk associated with fomite (0.26, 5th – 95th percentile: 0.10–0.56) or aerosol exposure alone (0.05, 5th – 95th percentile: 0.01–0.13) at 1 m distance was substantially lower (73–95%). At 1 m, droplet transmission predominated over aerosol and fomite-mediated transmission, however, this changed by 3 m, with aerosols comprising the majority of the exposure dose. Increasing physical distancing reduced risk by 84% (1–2 m) and 91% (1–3 m). Universal mask use reduced infection risk by 52–88%, depending on mask type. Increasing ventilation (from 0.1 to 2–8 air changes/hour) resulted in risk reductions of 14–54% (1 m) and 55–85% (2 m). Combining these strategies, together with handwashing and surface disinfection, resulted in <1% infection risk. Partial or full vaccination of the susceptible worker resulted in risk reductions of 73–92% (1 m risk range: 0.08–0.26). However, vaccination paired with other interventions (ACH 2, mask use, or distancing) was necessary to achieve infection risks <1%. Current industry SARS-CoV-2 risk reduction strategies, particularly when bundled, provide significant protection to essential food workers.</p>\n",

       "            </header>\n",
       "            <p>In response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia introduced public health and physical distancing restrictions in late March 2020. We investigated the impact of these restrictions on HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among Australian gay and bisexual men (GBM). METHODS: Participants in an ongoing online cohort study previously reported PrEP use from 2014 to 2019. In April 2020, 847 HIV-negative and untested participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in PrEP use as a result of COVID-19 public health measures. Binary logistic multiple regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to compare changes in PrEP use behaviors. RESULTS: Among 847 men, mean age was 44.1 years (SD: 12.7). PrEP use rose from 4.9% in 2015 to 47.2% in 2020. Among those, 41.8% (n = 167) discontinued PrEP use during COVID-19 restrictions. Discontinuing PrEP during COVID-19 restrictions was independently associated with being less likely to have recently tested for HIV (aOR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.34; P < 0.001) and less likely to report sex with casual partners (aOR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.54; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: By April 2020, following the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions, GBM dramatically reduced PrEP use, coinciding with a reduction in sexual activity. Longer-term impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on sexual behaviors among GBM need to be monitored because they may foreshadow fluctuations in prevention coverage and risk of HIV infection. Our findings indicate a potential need for clear, targeted information about resumption of PrEP and on-demand optimal dosing regimens in response to ongoing changes in restrictions.</p>\n",

       "            <p>Religious activities tend to be conducted in enclosed, crowded, and close-contact settings, which have a high potential of transmitting the coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19); therefore, religious communities are expected to take appropriate infection prevention measures. Meanwhile, during past disasters, religious communities have provided various types of support to affected people; hence, their role in disaster risk reduction has received much attention. In this study, we aimed to identify the infection prevention measures and support provision implemented by mosques—Islamic institutions managed and operated mainly by foreign Muslims living in Japan—during the one year from January 2020. We collected information from newspaper articles (18 articles on 19 mosques) and interviews with representatives of three mosques. We found that various infection control measures were implemented in mosques—refraining from mass prayers and closing buildings from an early stage (around February 2020); canceling large-scale events during the month of Ramadan; moving some activities online; and ensuring indoor ventilation and safe physical distance even when continuing face-to-face prayer activities. We also found that various types of support were provided by mosques—donating masks to the local government; listening to problems of people affected by COVID-19 regardless of their nationality; providing financial support to them; translating and disseminating information to foreign Muslims; and providing religious meals for them. This study provides actual examples of infection prevention measures taken by mosques in a Muslim-minority society and suggests that mosques appropriately responded to the needs of religious minorities during disasters, including COVID-19.</p>\n",

       "            <p>Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been crucial for controlling COVID-19. They are complemented by voluntary health-protective behaviour, building a complex interplay between risk perception, behaviour, and disease spread. We studied how voluntary health-protective behaviour and vaccination willingness impact the long-term dynamics. We analysed how different levels of mandatory NPIs determine how individuals use their leeway for voluntary actions. If mandatory NPIs are too weak, COVID-19 incidence will surge, implying high morbidity and mortality before individuals react; if they are too strong, one expects a rebound wave once restrictions are lifted, challenging the transition to endemicity. Conversely, moderate mandatory NPIs give individuals time and room to adapt their level of caution, mitigating disease spread effectively. When complemented with high vaccination rates, this also offers a robust way to limit the impacts of the Omicron variant of concern. Altogether, our work highlights the importance of appropriate mandatory NPIs to maximise the impact of individual voluntary actions in pandemic control.</p>\n",

       "            </header>\n",
       "            <p>OBJECTIVES: Owing to the spread of COVID-19, many companies are likely to experience a significant impact on not only the safety and health of employees, but also on their businesses. The impact may be more severe for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) than large enterprises, given their limited management resources. This study aims to clarify the good practices of institutional measures, the challenges in implementing these measures, and the required supports among SMEs. METHODS: The authors conducted an interview survey in August-October 2020 covering 27 SMEs in Japan regarding the infection control measures implemented and the desired supports in the future. Based on the content analysis, four researchers, comprising two occupational physicians and occupational health nurses each, extracted small categories by focusing on the commonality of codes, and gradually increased the degree of abstraction, subsequently extracting large categories. RESULTS: The study consolidated the implemented institutional measures into four categories: \"making immediate decisions,\" \"obtaining accurate information and sharing it with all employees,\" \"strengthening infection control measures,\" and \" launching efforts to continue business.\" In addition, challenges in implementing institutional measures were classified into five categories: \"information gathering,\" \"counter measures against unknown virus,\" \"poor accessibility to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test,\" \"consensus building,\" and \"balancing business continuity and infection control.\" Furthermore, desired support in the future was classified into three categories: \"information gathering,\" \"accessibility to PCR test,\" and \"compensation and subsidy.\" CONCLUSIONS: With taking the advantage of the characteristics of SMEs, not a few companies implemented the four categories of institutional measures. Therefore, it is imperative for SMEs to provide accurate information to employers for appropriately recognizing the risks. Accordingly, it is desirable for occupational health professionals at SMEs to provide support to employers to help them identify appropriate information.</p>\n",

       "            <p>BACKGROUND: COVID19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. As there has been no definitive treatment for the disease so far, the only way to control the spread is to break the chain of infection. Our study aimed to analyze the preventive behaviors and influencing factors in the Iranian population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was a web-based survey in the Iranian population. We performed the study during the first peak of COVID-19 outbreak (from March 25th, 2020 to April 5th()). We used demographic and Preventive behaviors questionnaires to collect the data. This web-based survey was publicized on the internet through the common platforms used by the Iranian population. This survey was released on the website “Porsline.com”. A total of 2097 acceptable questionnaires were filled. All data were analyzed, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19. RESULTS: 61.9% of the participants checked the hand-washing question as “Always”. 55.7 and 58.2% checked the wearing masks and gloves as “Always”, respectively. We found a significant relationship between gender and hand washing behavior (P = 0.006) and the use of masks and gloves (P < 0.001). Results showed that wearing gloves had a significant relation with the education status (P = 0.029) and economic status (P = 0.011). Wearing masks had a significant relation with economic status (P = 0.032). Overall women had better preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive behaviors have a significant relation with some socio-demographic characteristics. According to the 3 main preventive behaviors of hand-washing, wearing masks and gloves 50% of the population has not taken these behaviors seriously.
