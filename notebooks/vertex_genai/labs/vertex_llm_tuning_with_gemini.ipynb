    "You can configure a model tuning job to collect the following validation metrics for gemini-1.0-pro-002 by passing an evaluation dataset as we did in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "`/eval_total_loss`: Loss for the validation dataset at a validation step.\n",
    "`/eval_fraction_of_correct_next_step_preds`: The token accuracy at an validation step. A single prediction consists of a sequence of tokens. This metric measures the accuracy of the predicted tokens when compared to the ground truth in the validation dataset.\n",
    "`/eval_num_predictions`: Number of predicted tokens at a validation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics visualizations are available after the model tuning job completes. \n",
    "If you don't specify a validation dataset when you create the tuning job, \n",
    "only the visualizations for the tuning metrics are available.\n",
