    "Dev Ops practices will regularly make use of multiple deployments to manage application deployment scenarios such as \"Continuous Deployment\", \"Blue-Green Deployments\", \"Canary Deployments\" and more. This lab is to provide practice in scaling and managing containers so you can accomplish these common scenarios where multiple heterogeneous deployments are being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous deployments typically involve connecting two or more distinct infrastructure environments or regions to address a specific technical or operational need. Heterogeneous deployments are called \"hybrid\", \"multi-cloud\", or \"public-private\", depending upon the specifics of the deployment. For the purposes of this lab, heterogeneous deployments include those that span regions within a single cloud environment, multiple public cloud environments (multi-cloud), or a combination of on-premises and public cloud environments (hybrid or public-private).\n",
    "\n",
    "Three common scenarios for heterogeneous deployment are multi-cloud deployments, fronting on-premises data, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercises practice some common use cases for heterogeneous deployments, along with well-architected approaches using Kubernetes and other infrastructure resources to accomplish them."
