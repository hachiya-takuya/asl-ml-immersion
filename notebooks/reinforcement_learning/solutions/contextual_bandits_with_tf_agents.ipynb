    "*Contextual Bandit (CB)* is a machine learning framework in which a *agent* selects actions (also called *arms*) in order to maximize rewards in the long term. At each round, the agent receives some information about the current state (also called the *context*) and uses this information to select an action. As a consequence of this choice, it receives a *reward*. "

    "On the one hand, contextual bandit is one of the simplest instance of a *reinforcement learning problem* where a single state (or context) is provided to the agent and the play or *episode* stops after the first action has been chosen and the reward gotten. This setting appears in a number of useful problems in the industry, one of the best known being that of ad placements on a website: The different ads to publish on a webpage are the different actions, the context is given by a user features, and the reward is 1 is the user clicks on the published ad and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, contextual bandit is a natural generalization of a classification problem in supervized learning. Namely, consider a data set of points $(x, y)$ where the $x$'s are the features and the $y$'s are the labels in $k$ possible classes. We can setup an associated contextual bandit problem as follows: The CB agent at each time step is given the context $x$. From that information, it needs to select from $k$ possible actions which are the $k$ possible classes. If the agent chooses the correct class for feature $x$, then the reward is $1$, and zero otherwise. The general goal of maximising the long-term cumulative reward for the CB agent is equivalent to that of minimizing the training loss in supervized learning. Contextual bandit is more general than classification though, since in many useful CB settings we actually know the reward only for the  actions we have taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will learn how to solve a contextual bandit problem derived from a classification dataset with *Q-learning* and the associated *neural epsilon-greedy strategy* using a powerful reinforcement learning library written in tensorflow: [TensorFlow Agents](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents).

Example: In this example we have seven arms: one of each of the classes, and if we set epsilon to say 10%, then 90% of the times the agent will choose the arm with the highest value estimate (exploiting the one most likely to be the predicted class) and 10% of the time it will choose a random arm from all of the 7 arms( thus exploring the other possibilities).

    "Reinforcement learning algorithms use replay buffers to store trajectories of experience when executing a policy in an environment. During training, replay buffers are queried for a subset of the trajectories (either a sequential subset or a sample) to \"replay\" the agent's experience. Sampling from the replay buffer facilitate data re-use and breaks harmful co-relation between sequential data in RL, although in contextual bandits this isn't absolutely required but still helpful.\n",

(This is the amount of sequential time steps which will be considered as one data point). So a batch of 3 with 2 time steps each would result in a tensor of shape `(3,2)`. Since unlike regular RL problems, contextual bandits have only one time step we can keep `max_length = 1`. However since this tutorial is to enable you for RL problems as well, let set it to 2.
