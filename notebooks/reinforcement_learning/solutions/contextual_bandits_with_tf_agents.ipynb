    "*Contextual Bandit (CB)* is a machine learning framework in which a *agent* selects actions (also called *arms*) in order to maximize rewards in the long term. At each round, the agent receives some information about the current state (also called the *context*) and uses this information to select an action. As a consequence of this choice, it receives a *reward*. "

    "On the one hand, contextual bandit is one of the simplest instance of a *reinforcement learning problem* where a single state (or context) is provided to the agent and the play or *episode* stops after the first action has been chosen and the reward gotten. This setting appears in a number of useful problems in the industry, one of the best known being that of ad placements on a website: The different ads to publish on a webpage are the different actions, the context is given by a user features, and the reward is 1 is the user clicks on the published ad and 0 otherwise."

    "On the other hand, contextual bandit is a natural generalization of a classification problem in supervized learning. Namely, consider a data set of points $(x, y)$ where the $x$'s are the features and the $y$'s are the labels in $k$ possible classes. We can setup an associated contextual bandit problem as follows: The CB agent at each time step is given the context $x$. From that information, it needs to select from $k$ possible actions which are the $k$ possible classes. If the agent chooses the correct class for feature $x$, then the reward is $1$, and zero otherwise. The general goal of maximising the long-term cumulative reward for the CB agent is equivalent to that of minimizing the training loss in supervized learning. Contextual bandit is more general than classification though, since in many useful CB settings we actually know the reward only for the  actions we have taken. "

For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
