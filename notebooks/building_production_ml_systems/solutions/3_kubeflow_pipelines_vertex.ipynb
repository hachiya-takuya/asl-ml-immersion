    "This notebook shows how to use the components defined in [`google_cloud_pipeline_components`](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/google-cloud) in conjunction with an experimental `run_as_aiplatform_custom_job` method, to build a [Vertex Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines) workflow that trains a [custom model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/containers-overview), uploads the model, creates an *endpoint*, and deploys the model to the endpoint. \n",
