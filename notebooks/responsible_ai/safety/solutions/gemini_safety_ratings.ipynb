    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) can translate language, summarize text, generate creative writing, generate code, power chatbots and virtual assistants, and complement search engines and recommendation systems. The incredible versatility of LLMs is also what makes it difficult to predict exactly what kinds of unintended or unforeseen outputs they might produce. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these risks and complexities, the Vertex AI Gemini API is designed with [Google's AI Principles](https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/) in mind. However, it is important for developers to understand and test their models to deploy safely and responsibly. To aid developers, Vertex AI Studio has built-in content filtering, safety ratings, and the ability to define safety filter thresholds that are right for their use cases and business.\n",
