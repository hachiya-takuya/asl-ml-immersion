    "[Differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) (DP) is a framework for measuring the privacy guarantees provided by an algorithm. Through the lens of differential privacy, you can design machine learning algorithms that responsibly train models on private data. Learning with differential privacy provides measurable guarantees of privacy, helping to mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive training data in machine learning. Intuitively, a model trained with differential privacy should not be affected by any single training example, or small set of training examples, in its data set. This helps mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive training data in ML."

    "1. First, the sensitivity of each gradient needs to be bounded. In other words, you need to limit how much each individual training point sampled in a minibatch can influence gradient computations and the resulting updates applied to model parameters. This can be done by *clipping* each gradient computed on each training point.\n",
    "2. *Random noise* is sampled and added to the clipped gradients to make it statistically impossible to know whether or not a particular data point was included in the training dataset by comparing the updates SGD applies when it operates with or without this particular data point in the training dataset.\n"

    "2. `noise_multiplier` (float) - The amount of noise sampled and added to gradients during training. Generally, more noise results in better privacy (often, but not necessarily, at the expense of lower utility).\n",
    "3.   `microbatches` (int) - Each batch of data is split in smaller units called microbatches. By default, each microbatch should contain a single training example. This allows us to clip gradients on a per-example basis rather than after they have been averaged across the minibatch. This in turn decreases the (negative) effect of clipping on signal found in the gradient and typically maximizes utility. However, computational overhead can be reduced by increasing the size of microbatches to include more than one training examples. The average gradient across these multiple training examples is then clipped. The total number of examples consumed in a batch, i.e., one step of gradient descent, remains the same. The number of microbatches should evenly divide the batch size. \n",
    "4. `learning_rate` (float) - This hyperparameter already exists in vanilla SGD. The higher the learning rate, the more each update matters. If the updates are noisy (such as when the additive noise is large compared to the clipping threshold), a low learning rate may help the training procedure converge. \n",

It measures the strength of the privacy guarantee by bounding how much the probability of a particular model output can vary by including (or excluding) a single training point.
